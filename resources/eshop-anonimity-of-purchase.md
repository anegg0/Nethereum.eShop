A decent method to do this is by utilizing another personality (program, wallet, IP) for the assets of your new location. 

In the event that you are utilizing an open RPC with every one of your wallets, it may realize that your addresses are connected, for instance, in the event that you utilize a similar IP or API token for various characters. Note that on the off chance that you keep your wallets in Metamask, it will consequently utilize similar API token for every one of your solicitations.
